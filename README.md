# APIChartsJS
In this project I are comparing the US currency to other currencies. I have used for the currency data this [API](https://www.frankfurter.app/docs/),
I used for the chart drawing this [library](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/),
I have used some code for the table from this [resource](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp)
